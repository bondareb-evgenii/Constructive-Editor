General idea of a product is to give creative Lego players an easy and effective tool to generate build instructions of the Lego models they've made to share them or just keep memory of them.
The easiest and fastest way to do it is to make some pictures while disassembling the model. In most cases you decide to remember what you've done when you need some details of the model for other great creations of yours.
So the general and most common situation in which the user will use the Constructive software is a process of disassembling of his creation. He may either put photos he makes to the instruction one by one to not forget anything and keep the instruction being generated in track with a real model or just use a software on existing pictures set (which may be problematic sometimes if there are any steps or photos of disassembled details missing for example). But the last situation is also a common one as many people may have a picture set like instructions of their previous creations.
