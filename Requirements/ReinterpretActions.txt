What to do on reinterpret:

Split->Detach:
	- Split newly created base assembly to existing details
	- Use existing details as parts detached from the newly created assembly
	- Remove existing details after prompt

Split->Rotate(Transform):
	- Split newly created rotated(transformed) assembly to existing details
	- Remove existing details after prompt

Detach->Split: remove base assembly and smaller assemblies after prompt; leave details as is and inform user about it in the prompt (if it should be shown according to preferences)

Detach->Rotate(transform):
	- Detach existing parts from the newly created rotated(transformed) assembly
	- Use a base assembly as a rotated(transformed) assembly and remove smaller parts after prompt
	- Remove the existing base assembly and smaller parts after prompt

Rotate(transform)->Split: remove the rotated(transformed) assembly after prompt

Rotate(transform)->Detach:
	- Use rotated(transformed) assembly as a base one
	- Rotate(transform) a newly created base assembly
	- Remove the rotated(transformed) assembly after prompt

Rotate(transform)->Transform(rotate):
	- Use rotated(transformed) assembly as transformed(rotated) one
	- Transform(rotate) a newly created rotated(transformed)
	- Remove the existing rotated(transformed) assembly after prompt
